# Jump / CTDirect comparison - algal bacterial problem

Note that the problem is redefined for each method: jump, ctdirect and ctdirect new model.
Also, the Gauss Legendre 2 implementations for Jump and CTDirect here use a piecewise constant control (default for CTDirect would have been piecewise linear).

## Takeaways
- CTDirect still allocates at least x10 more memory, worsening for higher problem sizes
For the biggest allocations, a significant time is passed during the AD phase, before Ipopt. The runs marked with * spend half the time before optimization, likely some swap issue.
We note that Jump memory appears linear wrt steps for GL2, but a bit superlinear for Trapeze. CTDirect memory always increases superlinearly wrt steps.
- Hessian seems to be handled differently by Jump, see the higher nonzero values.
Maybe a less sparse but faster and less memory intensive method is used ? 
- convergence: objective and trajectory are similar, iterations differ, maybe due to the different hessian handling. Total computation times are similar for Trapeze and x2 to x5 slower for CTDirect for GL2, probably due to the memory effect.
- for GL2, Jump and CTDirect have slightly different nonzero counts for the Jacobian
- in terms of control structures, GL2 solutions are clean, Jump Trapeze solutions shows a bit of noise, while CTDirect Trapeze solutions are very noisy.

## Todo
- can we have linear memory wrt steps for Jump / Trapeze ?
- disable Hessian (in AD model then use ipopt limited memory option ?) and compare memory allocations and convergence. Find more details on the Hessian in Jump.
